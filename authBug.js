The Firebase SDK's `onAuthStateChanged` listener might not always trigger when the user's authentication status changes. This can occur due to various reasons, including network issues, background processes, and edge cases in the Firebase authentication system.  The listener's callback function might not be executed when expected, leading to unexpected behavior in the application.
