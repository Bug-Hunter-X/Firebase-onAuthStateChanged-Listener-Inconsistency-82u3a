# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Listener Inconsistency

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with the Firebase `onAuthStateChanged` listener. In certain situations, the listener may fail to trigger when expected, leading to inconsistencies in the application's authentication state.

The `authBug.js` file contains code illustrating the potential issue, while `authBugSolution.js` provides a solution involving multiple attempts to check authentication state within a specified timeout. This example uses a simple interval to retry authentication checks, but more sophisticated approaches may be necessary in production environments.
